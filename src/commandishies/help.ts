Hi ${placeholder}! Seems like you need some help. Here are some things I can do for you.

**"<@${placeholder}> I want musician and 2019 role please"** can get you some roles. It doesn't matter what you put, as long as the word "role" or "roles" is present in your message, I will know you want roles. I have artist, musician, cosplayer, meme, and roleplayer available, as well as the years 2012-2019.

**"<@${placeholder}> I was at galacon in 2014 and 2015"** can get you year roles. It doesn't matter what you put, as long as the word "galacon" is present in your message, I will know you want year roles. I have the years 2012-2019 available.

Thats all I do right now. If you need help, you can always ask <@${placeholder}> about it, she knows the most about me.
`;
